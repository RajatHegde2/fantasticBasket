Shop Application for Dynamically changing costs of products:

I developed a android application for a vegetable shop where the price of
product can change dynamically everyday.

It has two APPS:
1) For users
2) For Shopkeeper(Admin)

Shop Keeper has a special app where he can update prices and get orders from
users application.

User Application has registration and login page after which they need to enter
the products which they would like to buy.Billing will be done based on cost of
products updated by shopkeeper.

Software used: Android Studio
Database: Firebase
